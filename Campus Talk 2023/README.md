Trends of Cybersecurity: APT vs GPT 								My Campus Talk in 2023
In recent years, targeted cyber operations have increased significantly, the complexity of attacks continues to rise, and network security has become an important factor in national security. The offensive and defensive confrontations surrounding cyberspace have continued to escalate. This topic will review the development of cyberspace security in the past few decades, from the first PC virus in the 1980s to national-level Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) attacks in 2023. From signature-based virus defense technology to Security Copliot based on LLM. This topic will introduce the important development trends of in both offensive and defensive cybersecurity , and sharing my views on APT and GPT.
